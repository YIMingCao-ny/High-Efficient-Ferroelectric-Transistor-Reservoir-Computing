# High-Efficient-Ferroelectric-Transistor-Reservoir-Computing
Using the ferroelectric transistor as a computational platform, a nonlinear kinetic model of its ferroelectric layer polarisation has been developed and a physical RC has been designed using ferroelectric monopoles and ferroelectric arrays.By performing the numerical recognition task, the recognitio
